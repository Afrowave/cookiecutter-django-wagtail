Usage
------

Instead of using Wagtailâ€™s :code:`start` command you will use Cookiecutter to set up your project. Cookiecutter will prompt you for some  technical and administrative question like your name, email, and various configuration issues.

Install Cookiecutter first::

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.4.0"

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/Jean-Zombie/cookiecutter-django-wagtail/
    
You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Wagtail project will be created for you.

For local development, see the following:

* `Developing locally`_
* `Developing locally using docker`_
