## Constraints

- Registration via django-allauth\_ not implemented (unlike the OG Cookiecutter Django)
- Only maintained 3rd party libraries are used.
- Uses PostgreSQL everywhere (10.16 - 13.2)
- Environment variables for configuration (This won't work with Apache/mod_wsgi).

## Usage

Instead of using Wagtailâ€™s :code:`start` command you will use Cookiecutter to set up your project. Cookiecutter will prompt you for some technical and administrative question like your name, email, and various configuration issues.

Install Cookiecutter first::

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/Jean-Zombie/cookiecutter-django-wagtail/

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Wagtail project will be created for you.
