## Usage

Instead of using Wagtailâ€™s :code:`start` command you will use Cookiecutter to set up your project. Cookiecutter will prompt you for some technical and administrative question like your name, email, and various configuration issues.

First, get Cookiecutter:

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/Jean-Zombie/cookiecutter-django-wagtail/

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

Answer the prompts with your own desired [options](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project-generation-options.html). For example:

    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?

## For Readers of Two Scoops of Django

You may notice that some elements of this project do not exactly match what we describe in chapter 3. The reason for that is this project, amongst other things, serves as a test bed for trying out new ideas and concepts. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but the end result is that it won't necessarily match precisely what is described in the book I co-authored.
